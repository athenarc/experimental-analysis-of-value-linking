Each budget entry has a unique identifier (`budget_id`), a category (`category`), the amount budgeted (`amount`), the amount spent (`spent`), the remaining budget (`remaining`), the event status (`event_status`), and a link to the event (`link_to_event`).\n\n- **Expense**: Tracks expenses incurred by the club. Each expense has a unique identifier (`expense_id`), a description (`expense_description`), the date it was incurred (`expense_date`), the cost (`cost`), an approval status (`approved`), a link to the member who incurred the expense (`link_to_member`), and a link to the relevant budget entry (`link_to_budget`).\n\n- **Income**: Records income received by the club. Each income record has a unique identifier (`income_id`), the date it was received (`date_received`), the amount (`amount`), the source of the funds (`source`), optional notes (`notes`), and a link to the member associated with the income (`link_to_member`).\n\n- **Member**: Contains information about each member of the club.

This database can be used for predictive modeling and analysis to identify patterns and risk factors associated with thrombosis.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n\n### Examination:\n- **ID**: An integer identifier for the patient. It is non-unique and can include null values. This field links the examination data to the patient.\n- **Examination Date**: The date when the examination was conducted. It is a non-unique field that can include null values.\n- **aCL IgG**: Concentration of anti-Cardiolipin antibody (IgG). This is a real number field that does not allow null values.\n- **aCL IgM**: Concentration of anti-Cardiolipin antibody (IgM). This is a real number field that does not allow null values.\n- **ANA**: Concentration of anti-nucleus antibody. This is an integer field that can include null values.\n- **ANA Pattern**: Text description of the pattern observed in the ANA examination. This field can include null values.\n- **aCL IgA**: Concentration of anti-Cardiolipin antibody (IgA). This is an integer field that does not allow null values.\n- **Diagnosis**: Text field containing the names of diseases diagnosed. This field can include null values.\n- **KCT, RVVT, LAC**: These fields indicate the degree of coagulation with values '+' for positive and '-' for negative. They do not allow null values.\n- **Symptoms**: Text field describing other symptoms observed. This field can include null values.\n- **Thrombosis**: Integer indicating the degree of thrombosis, ranging from 0 (no thrombosis) to 3 (positive, mild). This field does not allow null values.\n\n### Patient:\n- **ID**: A unique integer identifier for each patient. This field does not allow null values and serves as the primary key.\n- **SEX**: Text field indicating the sex of the patient ('F' for female, 'M' for male). This field does not allow null values.\n- **Birthday**: Date of birth of the patient. This field can include null values.\n- **Description**: Date when the patient's data was first recorded.

It includes detailed information about each battle, the ships that were lost during these battles, and the number of casualties (both killed and injured) caused by these ships. The database is structured to maintain relationships between battles, ships, and casualties through foreign key constraints.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n- **battle**: This table contains information about individual battles. Each battle has a unique identifier (`id`), a name (`name`), a date (`date`), commanders from both the Bulgarian and Latin sides (`bulgarian_commander`, `latin_commander`), and the result of the battle (`result`).\n  \n- **ship**: This table holds details about ships that were lost during battles. Each ship has a unique identifier (`id`), a name (`name`), tonnage (`tonnage`), type (`ship_type`), location where it was last seen (`location`), and its final disposition (`disposition_of_ship`). The `lost_in_battle` field links each ship to a specific battle using the battle's `id`.\n\n- **death**: This table records the casualties caused by ships during battles. Each record has a unique identifier (`id`), a note providing additional context (`note`), the number of people killed (`killed`), and the number of people injured (`injured`). The `caused_by_ship_id` field links each casualty record to a specific ship using the ship's `id`.\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `ship.lost_in_battle` references `battle.id`: This establishes a relationship between the `ship` table and the `battle` table, indicating which battle resulted in the loss of each ship.\n- `death.caused_by_ship_id` references `ship.id`: This establishes a relationship between the `death` table and the `ship` table, indicating which ship caused the casualties recorded in each entry.\n",

This database is structured to provide comprehensive information about each student's academic journey, from enrollment in specific degree programs and courses to the generation of their academic transcripts.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n\n- **Addresses**: Stores detailed address information for students, including line addresses, city, zip/postcode, state/province/county, and country. Each address has a unique identifier (`address_id`).\n\n- **Courses**: Contains information about the courses offered, including course ID, name, description, and any additional details.\n\n- **Departments**: Lists all departments within the institution, with each department having a unique ID and name, along with a description and other details.\n\n- **Degree_Programs**: Details the degree programs available, linked to specific departments. It includes a summary name and description for each program.\n\n- **Sections**: Represents different sections of courses, each with a unique section ID, linked to a course ID, and includes a section name and description.\n\n- **Semesters**: Tracks the semesters during which courses are offered, with each semester having a unique ID, name, and description.\n\n- **Students**: Holds personal and contact information for students, including their current and permanent addresses (linked to the Addresses table), first and last names, contact numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and dates of registration and departure.\n\n- **Student_Enrolment**: Records the enrollment of students in specific degree programs during particular semesters. It links students to their degree programs and semesters.\n\n- **Student_Enrolment_Courses**: Links students' enrollments to specific courses they are taking, facilitating the tracking of individual course enrollments.\n\n- **Transcripts**: Maintains records of students' academic transcripts, including the date of the transcript and any additional details.\n\n- **Transcript_Contents**: Details the contents of each transcript, linking it to specific student courses, thereby providing a detailed breakdown of courses completed by each student.\n\nThis database structure ensures that all relevant academic and personal information about students is systematically stored and can be easily accessed and managed.\n",

This database is particularly useful for organizations such as aviation schools, military bases, or private aviation companies that need to track pilot qualifications and plane storage locations.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n- **PilotSkills**: This table stores information about the skills of pilots, specifically which planes they are qualified to operate and their age.\n  - `pilot_name`: A non-unique field of type CHAR(15) that holds the names of the pilots. It cannot be null.\n  - `plane_name`: A non-unique field of type CHAR(15) that indicates the name of the plane a pilot is skilled to operate. It cannot be null and serves as a foreign key referencing the `plane_name` in the `Hangar` table.\n  - `age`: An integer field representing the age of the pilot. It cannot be null.\n\n- **Hangar**: This table contains details about the planes stored in different hangars, including the unique name of each plane and the location of the hangar.\n  - `plane_name`: A unique field of type CHAR(15) that specifies the name of the plane stored in the hangar. It cannot be null and serves as a primary key.\n  - `location`: A unique field of type CHAR(15) that indicates the location of the hangar where the plane is stored. It cannot be null.\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- The `plane_name` field in the `PilotSkills` table is a foreign key that references the `plane_name` field in the `Hangar` table. This relationship ensures that only planes listed in the `Hangar` table can be associated with pilots in the `PilotSkills` table, maintaining data integrity and consistency.\n",

It includes details such as channel specifics, series episodes, ratings, and cartoon episodes. The database is structured to allow for efficient querying and management of television content across different channels.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n\n- **TV_Channel**: This table contains information about various television channels. Each channel has a unique identifier (`id`) and a unique name (`series_name`). Additional attributes include the country of origin, language, type of content, pixel aspect ratio, high-definition availability, pay-per-view options, and package options.\n\n- **TV_series**: This table holds detailed information about individual episodes of TV series. Each episode is uniquely identified by its `id` and `Episode` title. The table also includes the air date, rating, share, 18-49 rating share, number of viewers in millions (`Viewers_m`), weekly rank, and the channel it aired on (linked to `TV_Channel.id`).\n\n- **Cartoon**: Similar to `TV_series`, this table stores information about cartoon episodes. Each cartoon episode is uniquely identified by its `id` and `Title`. The table includes details such as the director, writer, original air date, production code, and the channel it aired on (linked to `TV_Channel.id`).\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `TV_series.Channel` references `TV_Channel.id`: This foreign key establishes a relationship between the TV series episodes and the channels they aired on.\n- `Cartoon.Channel` references `TV_Channel.id`: This foreign key links cartoon episodes to the channels they were broadcasted through.\n\nThis structure allows for a comprehensive view of television content, enabling queries that can span across channels, series, and cartoons, providing insights into viewing patterns, ratings, and production details.\n",

It is structured to allow for hierarchical organization of documents and collections, enabling complex queries and efficient data retrieval. The database uses SQLite as its Database Management System (DBMS).\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n\n- **Document_Subsets**: This table stores information about different subsets of documents. Each subset has a unique identifier (`Document_Subset_ID`) and a unique name (`Document_Subset_Name`). It also includes a description field (`Document_Subset_Details`) that can be used to provide additional information about the subset.\n\n- **Collection_Subsets**: Similar to `Document_Subsets`, this table holds information about subsets of collections. Each subset is uniquely identified by `Collection_Subset_ID` and has a unique name (`Collection_Subset_Name`). It also includes a description field (`Collecrtion_Subset_Details`), which should be noted has a typo in the original description (should be `Collection_Subset_Details`).\n\n- **Document_Objects**: This table contains details about individual document objects. Each document object is uniquely identified by `Document_Object_ID`. It includes fields for `Parent_Document_Object_ID` to establish a hierarchy among documents, `Owner` to specify who owns the document, `Description` to provide a brief description of the document, and `Other_Details` for any additional non-essential information.\n\n- **Collections**: This table manages collections of documents. Each collection is uniquely identified by `Collection_ID` and can have a parent collection specified by `Parent_Collection_ID`, allowing for nested collections. It includes fields for `Collection_Name` and `Collection_Description`.\n\n- **Documents_in_Collections**: This table establishes a many-to-many relationship between documents and collections. It links `Document_Object_ID` from `Document_Objects` with `Collection_ID` from `Collections`, indicating which documents belong to which collections.\n\n- **Document_Subset_Members**: This table defines the membership of document objects in document subsets. It links `Document_Object_ID` and `Related_Document_Object_ID` from `Document_Objects` with `Document_Subset_ID` from `Document_Subsets`, allowing for complex relationships and hierarchies within document subsets.\n\n- **Collection_Subset_Members**: This table defines the membership of collections in collection subsets. It links `Collection_ID` and `Related_Collection_ID` from `Collections` with `Collection_Subset_ID` from `Collection_Subsets`, enabling similar complex relationships and hierarchies within collection subsets.\n\nThe foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity across these tables, allowing for efficient querying and management of the hierarchical structure of documents and collections.\n",

Each sailor is uniquely identified by `sid`, and the table also includes their `name`, `rating`, and `age`.

The `color` field is mandatory but can be non-unique, meaning multiple boats can share the same color.\n\n- **Reserves**: This table records the reservations made by sailors for specific boats on certain days. It includes `sid` (sailor ID) and `bid` (boat ID) to link reservations to specific sailors and boats, respectively. The `day` field specifies the date of the reservation. Both `sid` and `bid` are mandatory and can be non-unique, allowing multiple reservations for the same sailor or boat. The `day` field is mandatory and unique, ensuring that no two reservations can be made for the same boat on the same day.\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `Reserves.bid` references `Boats.bid`: This foreign key ensures that each reservation is linked to a valid boat in the `Boats` table.\n- `Reserves.sid` references `Sailors.sid`: This foreign key ensures that each reservation is linked to a valid sailor in the `Sailors` table.\n",

This database is structured using SQLite as its Database Management System (DBMS). It includes tables that categorize cars by continent, country, manufacturer, model, and detailed car data such as fuel efficiency, engine specifications, and performance metrics.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n\n- **continents**: This table contains information about different continents. Each continent has a unique identifier (`ContId`) and a name (`Continent`).\n\n- **countries**: This table lists countries along with their unique identifiers (`CountryId`), names (`CountryName`), and the continent they belong to (`Continent`), which references the `ContId` in the `continents` table.\n\n- **car_makers**: This table provides details about car manufacturers. Each manufacturer has a unique identifier (`Id`), a short name (`Maker`), a full name (`FullName`), and the country where it is based (`Country`), which references the `CountryId` in the `countries` table.\n\n- **model_list**: This table contains a list of car models along with their unique identifiers (`ModelId`), the manufacturer of each model (`Maker`), which references the `Id` in the `car_makers` table, and the model name (`Model`).\n\n- **car_names**: This table holds specific car names along with their unique identifiers (`MakeId`), the model they belong to (`Model`), which references the `Model` in the `model_list` table, and the make of the car (`Make`).\n\n- **cars_data**: This table includes detailed technical data for each car. Each entry has a unique identifier (`Id`), which references the `MakeId` in the `car_names` table, and includes fields for miles per gallon (`MPG`), number of cylinders (`Cylinders`), engine displacement (`Edispl`), horsepower (`Horsepower`), weight (`Weight`), acceleration time (`Accelerate`), and the year of manufacture (`Year`). \n\nThe relationships between these tables are established through foreign key constraints, linking car makers to countries, models to makers, car names to models, and car data to car names, ensuring a coherent and organized structure for the car-related information stored in the database.\n",

It includes tables that define template types, templates themselves, documents created using these templates, and the paragraphs within those documents. This structure allows for efficient management and retrieval of document templates and their contents.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n- **Ref_Template_Types**: This table defines different types of templates available in the system. Each template type has a unique code (`Template_Type_Code`) and a description (`Template_Type_Description`). These codes are used to categorize templates in the `Templates` table.\n  \n- **Templates**: This table contains detailed information about each template. Each template is identified by a unique `Template_ID` and is linked to a specific `Template_Type_Code` from the `Ref_Template_Types` table. Templates have a version number (`Version_Number`), and their validity period is defined by `Date_Effective_From` and `Date_Effective_To`. The `Template_Details` field can be used to store additional information about the template.\n\n- **Documents**: This table holds information about documents that are created using the templates defined in the `Templates` table. Each document is uniquely identified by `Document_ID` and is linked to a `Template_ID` from the `Templates` table. Documents have a name (`Document_Name`), a description (`Document_Description`), and an optional `Other_Details` field for any additional information.\n\n- **Paragraphs**: This table stores the text content of documents. Each paragraph is uniquely identified by `Paragraph_ID` and is linked to a `Document_ID` from the `Documents` table. The `Paragraph_Text` field contains the actual text of the paragraph, and there is an optional `Other_Details` field for any additional information related to the paragraph.\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `Templates.Template_Type_Code` references `Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code`: Establishes the relationship between templates and their types.\n- `Documents.Template_ID` references `Templates.Template_ID`: Links documents to the templates they are based on.\n- `Paragraphs.Document_ID` references `Documents.Document_ID`: Connects paragraphs to the documents they belong to.\n",

The `Author_ID` and `Name` fields are unique, ensuring no duplicate entries for the same author.\n  \n- **press**: This table holds details about the publishing presses. Each press is identified by a unique `Press_ID`, has a `Name`, and financial performance metrics (`Month_Profits_billion` and `Year_Profits_billion`) which are also unique for each press.\n\n- **book**: This table provides detailed information about the books. Each book is uniquely identified by `Book_ID`, has a `Title`, belongs to a `Book_Series`, is authored by an `Author_ID`, and published by a `Press_ID`. The `Sale_Amount` and `Release_date` provide additional details about the book's sales and publication date. The `Book_ID`, `Title`, `Sale_Amount`, and `Release_date` fields are unique to prevent duplication of book records.\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `book.Press_ID` references `press.Press_ID`: This establishes a relationship between the books and the presses that publish them.\n- `book.Author_ID` references `author.Author_ID`: This links each book to its author, indicating who wrote the book.\n",

It includes information about customers, gas stations, products purchased, individual transactions, and monthly consumption summaries. The database is structured to facilitate analysis of spending patterns, customer segments, and transaction details across different gas station chains and product categories.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n\n- **customers**: This table contains information about the customers using the debit cards. Each customer is uniquely identified by `CustomerID`. The table includes the customer's segment (`Segment`) which categorizes them into groups such as SME, LAM, or KAM, and the currency (`Currency`) they use, which can be either EUR or CZK.\n\n- **gasstations**: This table provides details about the gas stations where transactions occur. Each gas station is uniquely identified by `GasStationID`. The table includes the `ChainID` to identify which chain the gas station belongs to, the `Country` where the gas station is located (either CZE or SVK), and the `Segment` which describes the type of service offered by the gas station (e.g., Value for money, Discount, Other).\n\n- **products**: This table lists the products available for purchase at the gas stations. Each product is uniquely identified by `ProductID`. The table includes a `Description` field that provides a textual description of the product.\n\n- **transactions_1k**: This table records each individual transaction made using the debit card. Each transaction is uniquely identified by `TransactionID`. The table includes the date and time of the transaction (`Date`, `Time`), the IDs of the customer, card, gas station, and product involved in the transaction (`CustomerID`, `CardID`, `GasStationID`, `ProductID`), the amount of the product purchased (`Amount`), and the total price of the transaction (`Price`). The price is calculated as the product of the amount and the unit price of the product.\n\n- **yearmonth**: This table summarizes the monthly consumption of each customer. It includes the `CustomerID` to identify the customer, the `Date` in the format YYYYMM to indicate the month, and the `Consumption` which represents the total amount spent by the customer in that month. This table is useful for analyzing spending trends over time for individual customers.\n",

The `Year` column is constrained to only include values from 2003 and 2004.\n\n- **institution**: This table holds data about institutions. Each institution has a unique identifier (`Institution_ID`), a name (`Institution_Name`), a location (`Location`), and the year it was founded (`Founded`). Both `Institution_Name` and `Location` are unique across the table.\n\n- **staff**: This table provides details about the staff members. Each staff member has a unique identifier (`staff_ID`), a name (`name`), age (`Age`), nationality (`Nationality`), and an associated institution (`Institution_ID`). The `name`, `Age`, and `Institution_ID` are unique for each staff member.\n\n- **conference_participation**: This table records which staff members participated in which conferences and what roles they played. It includes foreign keys linking to the `conference` and `staff` tables (`Conference_ID` and `staff_ID` respectively) and a `role` column that specifies the role of the staff member in the conference (e.g., Speaker, Participant, Sponsor).\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `staff.Institution_ID` references `institution.Institution_ID`: Links each staff member to their respective institution.\n- `conference_participation.Conference_ID` references `conference.Conference_ID`: Links each participation record to a specific conference.\n- `conference_participation.staff_ID` references `staff.staff_ID`: Links each participation record to a specific staff member.\n",
